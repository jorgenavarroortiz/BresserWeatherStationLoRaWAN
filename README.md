# BresserWeatherSensorReceiver with Bresser 7-in-1 decoder

This repository is based on [matthias-bs' BresserWeatherSensorReceiver repo](https://github.com/matthias-bs/BresserWeatherSensorReceiver). Its main addition is to include the Bresser 7-in-1 decoder, since matthias-bs' repo only includes the decoders for Bresser 5-in-1/6-in-1.

Tested with the `BresserWeatherSensorBasic.ino` example and with the following equipment:
- [BRESSER 7-in-1 ClimateConnect Tuya Smart Home Weather Station](https://www.bresser.de/en/Weather-Time/BRESSER-7-in-1-ClimateConnect-Tuya-Smart-Home-Weather-Station.html)
- [BRESSER professional 7-in-1 Wi-Fi Weather Station with Light Intensity and UV Measurement Function](https://www.bresser.de/en/Weather-Time/Weather-Center/BRESSER-professional-7-in-1-Wi-Fi-Weather-Station-with-Light-Intensity-and-UV-Measurement-Function.html). Data available at [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/dashboard/pws/IGRANA86), [Weather Cloud](https://app.weathercloud.net/d4424986045#current) and [AWEKAS](https://stationsweb.awekas.at/index.php?id=27737).

These stations also includes a light sensor, compared to the 6-in-1 weather stations. The microcontroller was a [Heltec Wireless Stick](https://heltec.org/project/wireless-stick/), which has an SX1276 LoRa chip with the same pinout than the TTGO LoRa32-OLED v2.1.6 board (already supported by mattias-bs' repo and selected as the board in the Arduino IDE).

In order to include the Bresser 7-in-1 decoder, I employed the [decoder from RTL_433](https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433/blob/master/src/devices/bresser_7in1.c) adapted to this repository (similar to the work done by mattias-bs for the Bresser 5-in-1 and 6-in-1 decoders).

**TO BE CHECKED**: The value for rain is incorrect in the RTL_433 tool. It shows 7.2 mm in a sunny day without rain (0.0 mm in the display). The Bresser 7-in-1 decoder employs 3 bytes, as the 6-in-1 decoder. However, the 5-in-1 decoder only employs 2 bytes. Using the first two bytes (msg[10] and msg[11]) the result is 0.0 mm, as it should be. This has to be tested once it is rainning (my weather station is not easily accessible).

A pull request has been submitted to the upstream repo with the new decoder.

Bresser 5-in-1/6-in-1 868 MHz Weather Sensor Radio Receiver for Arduino based on CC1101 or SX1276/RFM95W

The Bresser 5-in-1 Weather Stations seem to use two different protocols. First, the 6-in-1 decoder is tried. If this fails, the 5-in-1 decoder is tried.

| Model         | Sensor Type | Decoder Function                |

## Configuration

### Configuration by selecting a supported Board in the Arduino IDE

By selecting a Board and a Board Revision in the Arduino IDE, a define is passed to the preprocessor/compiler. For the boards in the table below, the default configuration is assumed based in this define. I.e. you could could use an Adafruit Feather ESP32-S2 with a CC1101 connected to the pins of you choice of course, but the code assumes you are using it with a LoRa Radio Featherwing with the wiring given below.

If you are not using the Arduino IDE, you can use the defines in the table below with your specific tool chain to get the same result.

If this is not what you need, you have to switch to **Manual Configuration**

   | Setup                                                          | Board              | Board Revision               | Define                 | Radio Module | Notes    |

The preprocessor will provide some output regarding the selected configuration if enabled in the Preferences ("Verbose Output"), e.g. 
```
ARDUINO_ADAFRUIT_FEATHER_ESP32S2 defined; assuming RFM95W FeatherWing will be used
[...]
Receiver chip: [SX1276]
Pin config: RST->0 , CS->6 , GD0/G0/IRQ->5 , GDO2/G1/GPIO->11
```

### Manual Configuration

See `WeatherSensorCfg.h` for configuration options.

* Set the desired radio module by (un-)commenting `USE_CC1101` or `USE_SX1276`.

  SX1276 is compatible to RFM95W and HPD13A.

* Set the I/O pinning according to your hardware

   | Define                     | Radio Module    | Configuration                                                    |
   | -------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | ESP32                      | user-defined    | generic, used for ESP32 boards if none of the above is defined   |
   | ESP8266                    | user-defined    | generic, used for ESP8266 boards if none of the above is defined |

* Data from multiple sensors can be received by setting `NUM_SENSORS` to an appropriate value in `WeatherSensorCfg.h`.

   e.g. `#define NUM_SENSORS 1`

* The sensors to be handled can be configured by two ways:
   * Add any unwanted sensor IDs to the exclude list `SENSOR_IDS_EXC`

     e.g. `#define SENSOR_IDS_EXC { 0x39582376 }`
  
   * Specify the wanted sensors explicitly in the include list `SENSOR_IDS_EXC` - if empty, all sensors will be used

     e.g. `#define SENSOR_IDS_INC { 0x83750871 }`

## SW Examples

### [BresserWeatherSensorBasic](https://github.com/matthias-bs/BresserWeatherSensorReceiver/tree/main/examples/BresserWeatherSensorBasic)

Uses default configuration [src/WeatherSensorCfg.h](https://github.com/matthias-bs/BresserWeatherSensorReceiver/blob/main/src/WeatherSensorCfg.h)

Really a very basic example. Good for testing the SW build, wiring and sensor reception/decoding. Output is printed to the serial console ([example](https://github.com/matthias-bs/BresserWeatherSensorReceiver/blob/main/examples/BresserWeatherSensorBasic/example.log)).
Data is provided by the `getMessage()`-method, which returns almost immediately (i.e. after a small multiple of expected time-on-air), even if no data has been received.

### [BresserWeatherSensorWaiting](https://github.com/matthias-bs/BresserWeatherSensorReceiver/tree/main/examples/BresserWeatherSensorWaiting)

Uses default configuration [src/WeatherSensorCfg.h](https://github.com/matthias-bs/BresserWeatherSensorReceiver/blob/main/src/WeatherSensorCfg.h)

Very similar to [BresserWeatherSensorBasic](https://github.com/matthias-bs/BresserWeatherSensorReceiver/tree/main/examples/BresserWeatherSensorBasic), but data is provided by the `getData()`-method, which waits until a complete set of data has been received or a timeout occurred. Output is printed to the serial console ([example](https://github.com/matthias-bs/BresserWeatherSensorReceiver/blob/main/examples/BresserWeatherSensorWaiting/example.log)).

### [BresserWeatherSensorCallback](https://github.com/matthias-bs/BresserWeatherSensorReceiver/tree/main/examples/BresserWeatherSensorCallback)

Uses default configuration [src/WeatherSensorCfg.h](https://github.com/matthias-bs/BresserWeatherSensorReceiver/blob/main/src/WeatherSensorCfg.h)

Based on [BresserWeatherSensorWaiting](https://github.com/matthias-bs/BresserWeatherSensorReceiver/tree/main/examples/BresserWeatherSensorWaiting), but repeatedly invokes a callback function while waiting for data. In this example, in each iteration of the wait-loop, a dot is printed. Output is printed to the serial console ([example](https://github.com/matthias-bs/BresserWeatherSensorReceiver/blob/main/examples/BresserWeatherSensorCallback/example.log)).

### [BresserWeatherSensorOptions](https://github.com/matthias-bs/BresserWeatherSensorReceiver/tree/main/examples/BresserWeatherSensorOptions)

Uses default configuration [src/WeatherSensorCfg.h](https://github.com/matthias-bs/BresserWeatherSensorReceiver/blob/main/src/WeatherSensorCfg.h)

Based on [BresserWeatherSensorWaiting](https://github.com/matthias-bs/BresserWeatherSensorReceiver/tree/main/examples/BresserWeatherSensorWaiting), but demonstrates the different options of the `getData()`-method which defined if enough sensor data has been received before returning. Output is printed to the serial console ([example](https://github.com/matthias-bs/BresserWeatherSensorReceiver/blob/main/examples/BresserWeatherSensorOptions/example.log)).


### [BresserWeatherSensorMQTT](https://github.com/matthias-bs/BresserWeatherSensorReceiver/examples/BresserWeatherSensorMQTT)

Uses default configuration [src/WeatherSensorCfg.h](https://github.com/matthias-bs/BresserWeatherSensorReceiver/blob/main/src/WeatherSensorCfg.h)

This is finally a useful application.

At startup, first a WiFi connection and then a connection to the MQTT broker is established. (Edit `secrets.h` accordingly!) Then receiving data of all sensors (as defined in NUM_SENSORS, see WeatherSensorCfg.h) is tried periodically. If successful, sensor data is published as MQTT messages, one message per sensor.
If the sensor ID can be mapped to a name (edit `sensor_map[]`), this name is used as the MQTT topic, otherwise the ID is used. From the sensor data, some additional data is calculated and published with the _extra_ topic.

The data topics are published at an interval of >`DATA_INTERVAL`. The _status_ and the _radio_ topics are published at an interval of `STATUS_INTERVAL`.

If sleep mode is enabled (`SLEEP_EN`), the device goes into deep sleep mode after data has been published. If `AWAKE_TIMEOUT` is reached before data has been published, deep sleep is entered, too. After `SLEEP_INTERVAL`, the controller is restarted. 

MQTT publications:

`<base_topic>/data/<ID|name>`    sensor data as JSON string - see `publishWeatherdata()`
     
`<base_topic>/radio`             CC1101 radio transceiver info as JSON string - see `publishRadio()`
     
`<base_topic>/status`            "online"|"offline"|"dead"$

$ via LWT

`<base_topic>` is set by `#define HOSTNAME ...`

`<base_topic>/data` JSON Example:
```
{"sensor_id":12345678,"ch":0,"battery_ok":true,"humidity":44,"wind_gust":1.2,"wind_avg":1.2,"wind_dir":150,"rain":146}
```

See [examples/BresserWeatherSensorMQTTCustom/Readme.md](https://github.com/matthias-bs/BresserWeatherSensorReceiver/blob/main/examples/BresserWeatherSensorMQTTCustom/Readme.md) for details.

### [BresserWeatherSensorDomoticz](https://github.com/matthias-bs/BresserWeatherSensorReceiver/examples/BresserWeatherSensorDomoticz)

Based on [BresserWeatherSensorMQTT](https://github.com/matthias-bs/BresserWeatherSensorReceiver/examples/BresserWeatherSensorMQTT). Provides sensor data as MQTT messages via WiFi to Domoticz (https://domoticz.com/) (MQTT plugin for Domoticz required). The MQTT topics are designed for using with Domoticz virtual sensors (see https://www.domoticz.com/wiki/Managing_Devices#Temperature and https://www.domoticz.com/wiki/Managing_Devices#Weather).

### CC1101

[Texas Instruments CC1101 Product Page](https://www.ti.com/product/CC1101)

**Note: CC1101 Module Connector Pitch is 2.0mm!!!**

Unlike most modules/breakout boards, most (if not all) CC1101 modules sold on common e-commerce platforms have a pitch (distance between pins) of 2.0mm. To connect it to breadboards or jumper wires with 2.54mm/100mil pitch (standard), the following options exist:

* solder wires directly to the module
* use a 2.0mm pin header and make/buy jumper wires with 2.54mm at one end and 2.0mm at the other (e.g. [Adafruit Female-Female 2.54 to 2.0mm Jumper Wires](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1919))
* use a [2.0mm to 2.54 adapter PCB](https://www.amazon.de/Lazmin-1-27MM-2-54MM-Adapter-Platten-Brett-drahtlose-default/dp/B07V873N52)

**Note 2: Make sure to use the 868MHz version!**

## Adafruit RFM95W LoRa Radio Transceiver Breakout

**Note: Make sure to use the 868MHz version!**
* [ADA3072](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3072) - 868/915 MHz version
* [ADA3073](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3073) - 433 MHz version
* RF connector
* Antenna

See [Adafruit RFM69HCW and RFM9X LoRa Packet Radio Breakouts - Pinouts](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rfm69hcw-and-rfm96-rfm95-rfm98-lora-packet-padio-breakouts/pinouts).

**Note:**
The RFM95W also supports FSK modulation and thus can be used to receive the weather sensor data.

## Antennas and RF Connectors

The required antenna depends on the signal path between weather sensor and CC1101 or RFM95W receiver. 

Some options are:
* wire antenna
* spring antenna (helical wire coil)
* rubber antenna

See [Adafruit Tutorial - Antenna Options](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-32u4-radio-with-lora-radio-module/antenna-options) for wire antenna lengths and uFL connector soldering.

The [Data Alliance](https://www.data-alliance.net/mhf-series-mhf1-mhf2-mhf3-mhf4/) website helped to sort out my RF connector confusion:

> Applications of MHF Connectors & Cables
>
> The MHF series of RF micro-connectors (mating heights listed below are the maximum):
> * MHF1 (also known as MHF) has a Mating Height of 2.5mm
> * MHF2 has a Mating Height of 2.1mm
> * MHF3 has a Mating Height of 1.6mm
> * MHF4 has a Mating Height of 1.2mm
>
> MHF3 connector is compatible with a W.FL connector while MHF2 connector is equivalent of U.FL connector. The MHF4 cable connector is the smallest while MHF1 connector is the largest which is comparable to a U.FL connector.

Personally I prefer the SMA connector over the uFL connector -  but be aware of the (usual) male/female connector types and the normal/reverse polarity types. See [SMA vs RP-SMA what is the difference?](https://forum.digikey.com/t/sma-vs-rp-sma-what-is-the-difference/550) by Digikey.
